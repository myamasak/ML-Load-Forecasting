This is a Machine Learning for Load Forecasting repository.

I'm working on Load Forecasting techniques, and this repository has the algorithms and the datasets that will be used in my study.

The datasets are from:
- ISO New England (https://www.iso-ne.com/)
- In the folder /datasets/, there are datasets from 2009-2017. I'll add until 2019.

I'm thinking to add this one as well:
- ONS from Brazil (http://www.ons.org.br/Paginas/resultados-da-operacao/historico-da-operacao/curva_carga_horaria.aspx)

It's a initial working, so I'm also learning and trying to get some results. Feel free to use.

The techniques that are and will be explored are:
- Artificial Neural Networks;
- Long Short-Term Memory;
- Automated Machine Learning (nni - https://github.com/microsoft/nni);
- Others.
